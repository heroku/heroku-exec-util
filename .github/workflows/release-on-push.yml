name: Release on Push

# This workflow creates GitHub releases and updates PR labels after release PRs are merged
# It triggers on push to branches defined in release-channels.yml (main, beta, alpha, etc.)
# This workflow is for PUBLIC repositories that need to use workflows from a PRIVATE repository
# It uses token-based checkout to access the private npm-release-workflows repository
#
# SETUP: Ensure WORKFLOWS_ACCESS_GITHUB_TOKEN secret is configured in repository settings
